  "recycling-title": "THE POWER OF WASTE",
  "recycling-description": "We are passionate about alternative energy resources through waste management and the critical role it plays in reducing our our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change As we seek moving away from fossil fuels towards sustainable alternatives, and waste can be utilized as a viable alternative to fossil fuels, waste-to-energy technologies are emerging as a promising solution. Waste-to-energy facilities use a variety of technologies to generate electricity, heat or biofuels from waste materials such as wood,paper, agricultural residues, and even household waste. Thus reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions Instead of filling up landfills and polluting our environment, waste can be used as a valuable resource to power homes, businesses, and even transportation. Join us to educate everyone to dispose his waste in a systematic manner and be able to reuse it as a valuable resource of energy and make a positive impact on the environment. This could only happen if we work together! ",

  "recycling-fuel-desc1": "SRF is a fuel that comes from dry, non-hazardous, non-recyclable waste like plastics, paper, textiles, wood, and other materials.",
  "recycling-fuel-desc2": "It is produced by shredding and drying the waste materials and  then compacting them into pellets or briquettes in 5 steps:  crushing, drying, sorting, second crushing, pelletizing.",
  "recycling-fuel-desc3": "The resulting fuel is a rich source of energy fuel with high-calorific value that can be used to produce heat and electricity or replace fossil fuels in industrial and energy generation applications.",
  "recycling-fuel-desc4": " SRF is considered a renewable energy source since it is derived  from waste materials that would otherwise be sent to landfill or  incinerated.",
  "recycling-fuel-desc5": "The cement industry is making a valuable contribution to climate and resource protection by replacing hard coal or lignite with SRF for energy production.",
  "recycling-fuel-desc6": "Every ton of SRF used instead of coal, carbon dioxide emissions  are reduced by two tons.",
  "recycling-fuel-desc7": "  It works as a waste disposal alternative to Landfill.helps reducing the amount of fossil fuel in the energy mix.SRF",
  "recycling-fuel-desc9": " In Europe we have around 100 SRF producers, 20 of them are located  in France.",
  "recycling-fuel-desc10": " 30% of non-mineral, non-hazardous waste goes to landfill, which  represents a SRF production potential in Europe of almost 70  million metric tons yearly.",
  "recycling-fuel-desc11": "  SRF consumption is getting higher in European countries like UK,  Germany and Holland.",

  "hydrogen-title": "THE POWER OF HYDROGEN",
  "hydrogen-desc1": "Hydrogen gas is a clean and renewable source of energy that could replace fossil fuels in a wide range of applications, from transportation to power generation. One of the most promising methods of producing hydrogen gas is through the process of electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules On average, producing 1 kilogram of hydrogen gas requires approximately 50 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity. This means that the efficiency of the process is approximately 60-70%, depending on the specific quipment and conditions used. To put this into perspective, a typical car with a 100-kilowatt fuel cell engine would require approximately 1 kg of hydrogen gas to travel 100 km. To produce this amount of hydrogen gas would require approximately 50 kWh of electricity. In terms of percentages, this means that approximately 30-40% of the energy used to produce the hydrogen gas is lost as waste heat during the  electrolysis process. The remaining 60-70% of the energy is stored in the hydrogen gas. Also wind or solar power, can further improve the environmental sustainability of the process. In conclusion, producing hydrogen gas from electricity and water is an  efficient and promising method of producing clean, renewable energy.",
  "hydrogen-challenge": "There are still some challenges to go through in order to have  hydrogen usage becoming very popular, mainly the safety issues:",
  "hydrogen-challenge-item1": " Storage: hydrogen is a very small molecule and can escape from  storage tanks or pipelines more easily than other gases. If  there is a leak, the hydrogen can quickly disperse and  represent danger.",
  "hydrogen-challenge-item2": " Hydrogen is often stored in high-pressure tank (700 bars),  which can rupture if the pressure exceeds the tank's capacity.",
  "hydrogen-challenge-item3": "   To avoid these issues high-quality materials should be used,  maintenance, regular inspections and implementing safety features  like pressure relief valves and leak detection systems should be  applied. By optimizing the efficiency of the electrolysis process,  and the safety challenges we could reduce our dependence on fossil  fuels and contribute to a more sustainable future.",
  "knowledge-title": "The power of Knowledge",
  "knowledge-desc1": "The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide level is nearly 417 ppm parts per million due to 2400 Gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) caused by human activities since the industrial era start. This includes emissions from fossil fuels, deforestation and other land-use changes.",
  "knowledge-desc2": " The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has  increased by more than 40% since the beginning of the industrial  era.",
  "knowledge-desc3": "To put this in perspective, it is estimated that the Earth's atmosphere can absorb a maximum of around 3,000 Gt of CO2 before reaching dangerous levels of global warming.",
  "knowledge-desc4": "To limit the most severe impacts of climate change, it is necessary to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.   Paris Agreement, signed by 197 countries in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. To achieve this goal, countries have pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and work towards a carbon-neutral economy.",
  "knowledge-desc5": "Within the last 50 years The ppm jumped from 315 to 415  Let’s imagine that the critical level for a human being to live and breath is 800 ppm (recommended indoor average is about 400 ppm).",
  "knowledge-desc6": "burning of fossil fuels for energy is the largest contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions, accounting for around 75%-85% of total emissions, mainly used for Industry, heat + electricity + transportation",
  "knowledge-desc7": "Fossil fuel use created 33.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2011 worldwide",
  "knowledge-desc8": "The aviation industry is responsible for around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions, with emissions projected to triple by 2050 if no action is taken.",
  "knowledge-desc9": "The use of coal as an energy source is declining in many countries, but it still accounts for around 40% of global electricity generation and is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation.",
  "knowledge-desc10": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that can capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and industrial processes and store them underground. It is currently in use in some parts of the world, but more widespread deployment is needed to reach global climate goals.",
  "knowledge-desc11": "Forests, oceans and other land ecosystems absorb around 30% of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions each year, leading to ocean acidification which threatens marine life and highlighting the importance of protecting forests to limit climate change.",
  "knowledge-desc12": "Climate change is causing more frequent and intense extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes.",
  "knowledge-desc13": "Around 1.1 billion people worldwide lack access to electricity, with many relying on fossil fuels such as kerosene for lighting and cooking. Transitioning to renewable energy sources can provide access to electricity while reducing carbon emissions.",
  "knowledge-desc14": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stated that to limit global warming to 1.5°C, carbon dioxide emissions need to be reduced by approximately 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels.",
  "knowledge-desc15": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28 times higher than carbon dioxide over a 100-year timescale. Agriculture and livestock contribute around 44% of human-caused methane emissions, highlighting the need for sustainable farming practices",
